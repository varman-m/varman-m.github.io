  <h3><center>about.</center></h3>
  <p><center>RLN Inc. is an organization which believes in informing, influencing and changing the way humans as conscious individuals can better themselves and the environment in that in which we live, through the lens of the neural sciences.</p>
  <p> the organization is divided into three main divisions.</p> 
  <p>click the links above for a description of each.</p></center>
</div>

<div id="RLN." class="tabcontent">
  <h3><center>RLN.</center></h3>
  <p><center>operating as a think tank, the RLN division is mainly about policy change and fostering positive cultural innovation through increasing social awareness and government policy modification with emphasis in realms of mental health advocacy and assisting marginalized sections of the population. 
  <p>RLN is originally derived from the Dutch word "rellen" which means "riot".</p> 
  <p>we aim to bring about positive change in the social and political spheres of everyday life through disruptive means.
  </center></p>

</div>

<div id="LRN." class="tabcontent">
  <h3><center>LRN.</center></h3>
  <p><center>the LRN division is about implementing the burgeoning amount of information that is continually growing everyday, for use in practical means.</center></p>
  <p><center>two projects are currently underway.</p></center>
  <p><center>1. the complete transformation of health records into digital format for allowing patients to securely access their own health records easily and conveniently and to allow increased agency to the individual of it's disclosure to various organizations such as immigration agencies and insurance companies. <!--Here is the link in which you can sign up to view your own medical records!-->
  <p><center>2. a CRO (contract-research organization) in which allows for the collection of brain scans and biometric data of the general population on a wide-scale, in which compensation would be provided to the individual for providing their brain readings and biometric data under a variety of tests for research and academic purposes. <!-- Here is the link to the CRO website in which you can find out more about how your own brain works! (Insert link here)-->
</div>

<div id="NRL." class="tabcontent">
  <h3><center>NRL.</center></h3>
  <p><center>the NRL division is for harbouring innovation in the emerging neurotechnology industry. 
  <p>current project includes the extremely light-weight brain sensing device named "Crown". It combines EEG, fNIRS, Transcranial Dopplers and novel neuroimaging technologies to provide accurate and easily discernable neural coordinates of various brain functions. So light-weight, discreet, and safe that it would be able to fit inside various headwear such as hats and helmets. It would subsequently be able to collect data about an individual's brain function throughout the day and then easily upload the resulting data to produce "a neurological diary" of an individual. <!--Click here to see how Crown works and to see how you can purchase one of your own!-->
  </center></p>
  <p><center>future projects include brain-stimulation technologies for positive, therapeutic use.</center></p>
